# Current known issues
- Deadboot. Simply bootloops on a fully black screen until you do a LMSA rescue.

# How to build
1. Repo sync the manifest for your chosen ROM (So far only tested on Android 12.1 ROMs, A11 GSIs boot)
2. Get prebuilt files (vendor,kernel) (NOTE: this is temporary, until someone makes vendor and kernel trees.)
    - Do a LMSA rescue, and get the files from C:\ProgramData\RSA\Download\RomFiles\TB_X606*\. 
    - You can also get them from [https://mirrors.lolinet.com/firmware/lenovo/Tab_M10_FHD_Plus_2nd_Gen/](https://mirrors.lolinet.com/firmware/lenovo/Tab_M10_FHD_Plus_2nd_Gen/).
    - After getting the files, unpack `boot.img`. Then, get the `kernel/zImage` file. Do not unpack the `vendor.img`
3. Place the files in the correct locations
    - Make a `prebuilt` folder, place the files in there.
4. Run `breakfast` and enter lineage_achilles6_row_wifi-userdebug
5. If `breakfast` shows no error, run `mka -j#` to build the ROM. (Replace -j# with the amount of threads you want to use. Eg: -j4)
6. Wait. If any errors related to the DT appear, report them in the `Issues` tab of this repository.
